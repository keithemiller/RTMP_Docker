# About
[Github URL](git remote add origin git@github.com:keithemiller/RTMP_Docker.git)
This Docker container will host the instant-replay service for the streams coming from the TopShelf light fixture. Consumes RTMP streams on `port 1935` and can get controlled on `port 80`. 
## Running
To build the docker container use:
`docker build -t rtmp .`
To run the docker container use:
`docker run --name RTMP_Server -p 80:80 -p 1935:1935 -p 8080:8080 -it rtmp`

# HLS
HLS seems to be supported in the HTML5 `<video></video>` tag, but only on Safari and edge.
